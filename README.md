# 🔥 Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection  

## 📌 Project Overview  

Cyber threats are growing exponentially, and traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS) struggle to keep up with **zero-day attacks** and evolving threats. This project leverages **machine learning** to detect network anomalies efficiently and improve cybersecurity defenses.  

Using the **CICIDS2017 dataset**, we implemented and evaluated **seven machine learning algorithms** to classify network traffic as benign or malicious, achieving **high detection rates** and optimizing feature selection for enhanced accuracy.  

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Identify **significant attributes** for detecting network intrusions.  
- Compare and optimize various **machine learning models** for intrusion detection.  
- Evaluate performance using key metrics such as **Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score**.  
- Develop a **robust, adaptive, and scalable** intrusion detection system.  

## 🛠 Methodology  

🔹 **Dataset**: CICIDS2017, which contains a mix of normal and attack traffic.  
🔹 **Feature Selection**: Using **Random Forest Regressor** to improve classification performance.  
🔹 **Machine Learning Models Used**:  
   - **Naïve Bayes**  
   - **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)**  
   - **Random Forest**  
   - **ID3 (Decision Tree)**  
   - **AdaBoost**  
   - **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**  
   - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
🔹 **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.  

## 📊 Key Findings  

- **Machine learning improves IDS performance**, with multiple models achieving **>70% detection accuracy**.  
- **Random Forest and ID3 performed exceptionally well**, proving their effectiveness for intrusion detection.  
- **Feature selection was critical**—eliminating irrelevant features improved speed and accuracy.  
- **Anomaly-based detection methods** help identify zero-day attacks, unlike traditional signature-based approaches.  

## 🔍 Results  

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|--------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Naïve Bayes** | 84% | 81% | 79% | 80% |
| **QDA** | 92% | 89% | 88% | 88% |
| **Random Forest** | 97% | 96% | 95% | 96% |
| **ID3** | 98% | 97% | 96% | 97% |
| **AdaBoost** | 77% | 75% | 74% | 75% |
| **MLP** | 76% | 73% | 72% | 73% |
| **KNN** | 96% | 94% | 93% | 94% |

## 🚀 Future Work  

🔹 Implement **deep learning models** (CNN, LSTMs) to improve classification.  
🔹 Integrate **real-time traffic monitoring** for continuous threat detection.  
🔹 Expand dataset coverage to include more **diverse cyber-attacks**.
